## Project Description

For this project, I am building out an ecommerce site (Exotic Auto Collection) using Next.js(front-end) and Sanity(API). The idea behind the project is to build a site for sell high end hard to find luxury/exotic vehicles. The site will have multiple pages for showcasing current inventory and coming soon vehicles for sale. Along with contact page for more details on a certain vehicle.

## API

Here is a sample code snippet from the api that I built for this project.
