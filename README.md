## Project Description

For this project, I am building out an ecommerce site (Exotic Auto Collection) using Next.js(front-end) and Contentful(API). The idea behind the project is to build a site for sell high end hard to find luxury/exotic vehicles. The site will have multiple pages for showcasing current inventory and coming soon vehicles for sale. Along with contact page for more details on a certain vehicle.

## API

Here is a sample code snippet from the api that I built for this project.

Time frames are also vital in the development cycle. You have limited time to code all phases of the app. Your estimates can then be used to evaluate app possibilities based on the time needed and the actual time before the app must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours to account for the unknown, adding an additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Also, put a gif at the top of your Readme before you pitch, and you'll get a panda prize.
